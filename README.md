# Demo Ansible Playbooks #

This project is meant to house playbooks used in various demos and talks that I give. It's also meant to be used for Ansible Tower demos.

This is a fully functional Ansible project, complete with `ansible.cfg`, inventory, and a sane directory structure. You can initialize the lab environment by running `vagrant up`. This repository can also be added as a Project in [Ansible Tower](https://www.ansible.com/tower).

Check out my [asciineema](https://asciinema.org/~samdoran) page for demos of some of the playbooks.
